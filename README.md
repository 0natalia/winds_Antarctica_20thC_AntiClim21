# winds_Antarctica_20thC_AntiClim21
Investigation of wind changes in Antarctica during the 20th Century, from two Reanalysis datasets.


* ### File REAN20thC_wind_speedXsam.m

Reads wind and slp data;

Calculates the SAM index and its trends for before and after 1975;

Calculates and plots the correlation beteen the SAM index and wind;


* ### File REAN20thC_wind_speed_diff.m

Reads wind and SLP data; 

Calculates the wind speed mean for the time series' 20 first and last years;

Calculates wind speed difference between the end and the begging of the period;

WS differences for the entire austral region, and specfic regions (Wilkes Glaciers, Amundsen Sea and Western Antarctic Peninsula)

* ### File ORAs4_sessoes_regionais.m

Reads ORAs4 data from 1958 to 2011;

Calculates potential temperature differences for years before and after 1975;

Plots vertical profiles of potential temperatures differences at specific locations;
